// The hermetic Bazel Go SDK version, declared once.
//
// This governs everything built through rules_go. It does NOT govern the host
// Go shipped in the bazel-ci container image: byoo-otel-collector's otelcol
// genrule builds against $PATH go, and that toolchain is paired with
// byoo-otel-collector/go.work instead. The two are allowed to differ, and
// tools/ci/check-go-version states both.
//
// This module has no source and is never built. It exists so that one file
// declares the toolchain and every consumer derives from it rather than
// repeating a literal:
//
//   - Bazel reads it via go_sdk.from_file in the root MODULE.bazel.
//   - GitHub Actions read it via setup-go's go-version-file.
//   - tools/ci/check-go-version asserts everything else agrees with it.
//
// rules_go's from_file requires a file named exactly go.mod, which is why this
// is a module rather than a plain .go-version file.
//
// To change the toolchain, edit the toolchain line below and nothing else, then
// run tools/ci/check-go-version to find anything that has drifted.
